# TALENT2017Group8

To run the main project, just run make in the Project/ folder. The executable will be placed in Project/build.
To change the oxygen isotope, go to Project/src/main.cpp and change the input file string to "O**.input". 

Note that this is not the fastest version we made, as some further improvements are left to the reader ;)
